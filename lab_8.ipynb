    "## Markov process\n",
    "A **Markov process** is a particularly simple kind of **stochastic process**. A **Markov process** is any stochastic process that preserves the **Markov property**:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Markov property\n",
    "\n",
    ">The distribution of the state at time $t$ depends **only** on the state at the previous time $t-1$. No other history influences the behaviour of the system. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sequential samples from a Markov process are **not** independent; each sample depends on the prior sample (and *only* on the prior sample).  These models are tractable to do computations with, and we can often approximate a stochastic process which might have long-term dependencies with a Markov process with a single step dependency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evolution over time\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider the process to evolve one time step after the other, so we have a state at time $t=0, t=1, \\dots$, represented by a random variable $X_t$, which takes on values $x_1, x_2, x_3, \\dots$ at each time step.\n",
    "\n",
    "The evolution of Markov process is described by a single conditional probability distribution, $P(\\vec{X}_t=x_t|x_{t-1})$, the **transition distribution**. It defines what values could occur in one time step, depending on those on the previous time step. Markov processes can have **discrete states** (i.e. their state transitions involve discrete random variables) or **continuous states** (continuous random variables). We will only deal with discrete time, discrete state Markov processes: Markov chains in DF(H)."

    "\n",
    "The candle light has a simple microcontroller, which updates the LED state every hundredth of a second (100Hz). Choosing a purely random light state for each frame is unsatisfying -- no matter how you choose the random distribution, the result is always \"too fast\". Because each frame is independent, there is no sense of continuity. The result is unusable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is to model this as a **stochastic process**; and a powerful way of simplifying that model so it can be made amenable to computational analysis that is to represent the process as a Markov process. This problem is a *discrete* Markov process, because there are two light states: *on* and *off* (we'll assume the light can't be partially on). Discrete Markov processes are known as **Markov chains. **\n",
    "\n",
    "We can do several things with any Markov chain:\n",
    "* we can **sample** processes from the chain (e.g. we can simulate the candle behaviour)\n",
    "* we can **estimate** or **infer** parameters from data (we can work out how the Markov chain was configured by observing)\n",

    "### Gilbert model\n",
    "\n",
    "A very simple Markov chain is the **Gilbert model**, which can be used to model \"sticky\" processes.  It is often used for simulating \"bursty\" network traffic, for example. This model has just two states $0$ and $1$ or $A$ and $B$, and the condition probability distribution gives the probability of transitions between these two states.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"imgs/gilbert.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The conditional probability can be written as a simple table:\n",
    "\n",
    "        |   | 0    | 1    |\n",
    "        |---|------|------|\n",
    "        | 0 | 1-p1 | p1   |\n",
    "        | 1 | p2   | 1-p2 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the total probability leaving from any given state must be 1.0, we only need two numbers $p_1$ and $p_2$ to fully determine the Markov chain for the Gilbert model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model can be seen as a process with a **transition distribution** $p(S_i|S_{i-1})$, where $S_i$ is the random variable representing the state at time $i$ (for a Gilbert model, the state is either 0 or 1). The state at time $i$ depends only on the state at the previous time step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing out every possible combination in full:\n",
    "$$\\begin{align*}P(S_i=0|S_{i-1}=0) &= 1-p_1\\\\\n",
    "P(S_i=0|S_{i-1}=1) &= p_2\\\\\n",
    "P(S_i=1|S_{i-1}=0) &= p_1\\\\\n",
    "P(S_i=1|S_{i-1}=1) &= 1-p_2\\\\\\end{align*}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we observe a previous state, we know the distribution over the following state.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simulation\n",
    "Let's simulate the Gilbert model first of all. Write a function `gilbert(state, p1, p2)` which will take a previous state (either 0 or 1), and two transition probabilities $p_1$ and $p_2$, and return the next state of the Markov chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see this is a biased coin toss, where the bias depends on the the result of the last coin toss.\n"
